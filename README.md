This project demonstrates how to build a basic tabbed interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features four tabs, with the first tab active by default. When a user clicks on a different tab, the content of the currently active tab is hidden and the content for the selected tab is displayed. The implementation focuses on DOM manipulation and event handling, providing a practical introduction to interactive web development.
